# mind_controlled_wheelchair
The project aims to implement a support and monitoring system for paraplegic people and people who have lost control of all motor functions of the body. I accomplished this by the use of a 'connected' wheelchair, which includes a sensor array to monitor the medical condition of the user.  I have completed this project using Arduino Uno board and other components such as brain wave sensor, Bluetooth module, Ethernet module and other sensors.It includes the working of brain wave sensor, and the controlling of wheelchair using voice control and the code used to move the wheelchair.
